# Bug log (subbox-app)

Correctness bugs only — things that are outright wrong. For rough-but-working
UX friction, use `ux-notes.md` instead. See `README.md` for the conservative
fix policy before touching either an OPEN entry or committing a FIXED one.

**Archiving (do this when you close a bug):** this file is re-read on every turn
of every cycle, so keep it to `OPEN` entries plus the compact **Closed** index at
the bottom. When you move a bug to FIXED, put its **full text verbatim** in
`bugs-archive.md` (which the loop never reads) and add **one line** to the Closed
index here (date | title | verdict | issue/PR). The one-liner is enough to stop a
future cycle re-investigating; the archive has the detail if ever needed.

## OPEN

<!-- One entry per bug. Include: date found, journey/route it showed up on,
     repro steps, evidence (screenshot path / console error), your hypothesis
     for root cause + which repo owns it, and an `Issue: <github url>` line
     (every bug gets a qa-bug tracking issue — see README hard rules / skill
     Step 1½). Remove an entry (move to FIXED) once actually fixed and verified,
     don't just mark it done. -->

### (latent, NOT user-reachable — no issue filed by design) `PymixController.syncTracks` posts to the wrong path

Added: 2026-07-22. Found while driving the pymix-qa `Sync` coverage row
(`../pymix-qa/docs/qa/features/sync.md`).

**Observation.** `pymix-api.ts`'s `syncTracks` definition
(`src/renderer/api/pymix/pymix-api.ts:159-167`) sets `path: 'sync'` —
identical to the plain `sync` action right above it (line 135) — instead of
`'sync/tracks'`. The two client actions exist to reach two different backend
matchers (`POST /sync` = single-stage `get_track_match`; `POST /sync/tracks` =
lenient multi-stage `query_tracks_by` → fallback `query_track_by_name`,
verified live in `../pymix-qa/docs/qa/features/sync.md`), but as written
`syncTracks` would silently hit the stricter `/sync` matcher instead.

**Why NOT filed / fixed.** `grep -rn "syncTracks\b" src/` finds zero call
sites outside `pymix-api.ts`/`pymix-controller.ts`/`pymix-types.ts`
themselves — no `features/` component ever invokes
`PymixController.syncTracks`. Same shape as the pymix-qa serato
`playlistIds`-ignored finding and the `/match/tracks` #28→#29 dead-duplicate
removal: repairing unreachable surface risks becoming its own bug if the real
fix (wiring up an actual caller) has different requirements than guessed here.
**Fix it when a UI callsite for the lenient matcher is wired up, alongside
that change, not now.** No `qa-bug` issue by design (nothing a user hits).

### (informational, not urgent) Playlist "Kodzo" has a duplicate track server-side

Added: 2026-07-09. Found while validating pymix#22's new
`subbox_id_divergence` signal for real (see `directives.md`).

Test account `test260526`'s "Kodzo" playlist has two distinct server tracks
with identical title/artist/album ("Damager (Hamdi Edit)" — Sammy Virji &
Interplanetary Criminal — DUBSTEP DELUXE (LDS 246)), each with its own
`subbox_id`. Downloading the playlist fetches one; the second then shows as
"missing" on the next preview forever (correctly — its distinct subbox_id
genuinely has no local match), and would be re-downloaded as an apparent
duplicate if the user did.

Not filing as a bug to fix — this is a data question (is the duplicate
intentional, a re-import artifact, two different masters of the same
track?), not a code defect, and out of scope for the sync-matching
directive. Flagging here so it isn't mistaken for a `subbox_id_divergence`
false positive if seen again — it's a real, correctly-flagged case.
